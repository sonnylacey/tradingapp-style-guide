<h1>Controls and the ContextMenu</h1>

<p>Controls are user interface elements that are added to a WinForm and are used to allow users to perform various actions, as well as to present information to users.  Controls can be manually created from their respective classes, and their properties and events individually coded, or the can be visually added to a WinForm using the TradeStation Development Environment’s Form Designer, where they can be easily resized and moved to their appropriate location.  Following are the controls currently available to TradingApps.</p>

HTML-based TradingApps reside inside of this control.<p>

<h3>ContextMenu</h3>
